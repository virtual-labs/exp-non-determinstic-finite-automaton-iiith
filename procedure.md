### Procedure


1. Please go through the theory to understand the formalisms of Non-Deterministic finite automaton (NFAs). Try to differentiate the notion on non-determinism from either determinism or randomness.
2. Once you are well acquainted with the theoretical aspects of NFAs, you may head to the simulation section of this experiment. Here, you would see a non-deterministic finite automata, an input string, and some controls. Please follow the instructions at the top of the page to help you use the controls. This simulation helps you understand the notion of "string acceptance by a non-deterministic finite automaton". Unlike the case of DFAs, there could exist more than one run for a given input string (due to non-determinism). Some runs could lead to rejection and some runs could lead to acceptance. 
3. We strongly advise you to do the pre- and post-tests to gain more familiarity with the concepts.
